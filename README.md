CoWord Tool

Co-word analysis is a content analysis technique that is effective in mapping the strength of association between keywords in textual data. Co-word analysis reduces a space of descriptors (or keywords) to a set of network graphs that effectively illustrate the strongest associations between descriptors [29, 30].
